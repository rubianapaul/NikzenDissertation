I decided to rent my fabulous Beachfront apartment because I think it has luxury conditions for visitors and I like to meet people from other countries. My renters are always delighted with the property and I enjoy seeing their faces as they come into the apartment and see the high standards in quality & style for their holiday. _x000D_
_x000D_
I love the place I live in, because it is calm, unbeatable, just by the seaside and for its accessibility to Oporto / Porto. Porto is close to it too (about 30 minutes away by bus from Porto and just 1 minute walk to bus stop). _x000D_
_x000D_
I love to arrive home after a long day's work in Porto / Oporto and in the minute I set foot in the entrance hall having Beach and Ocean views. The facilities on the site and the local facilities are more than you can expect with plenty to see, eat and drink. I love it: play a party of squash, swimming, walk on the beach, cycling, go to the beach bars..._x000D_

It's important to me that renters can relax and enjoy the luxurious comforts of this Beachfront Penthouse whilst sampling the delights of all that Oporto / Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia has to offer.

Welcome to our self-catered apartments!
 
Located on the historical center of Oporto, in the heart of a UNESCO World Heritage Center, you'll find a building that belongs to our family for four generations.
 
After my mother (Lu'is grandmother) passed away in 2010 I inherited this building and found a really degraded space with a lot of structural problems and fierce tenants.
 
Having one apartment vacant me and my sons decided to refurbish the entire apartment and prepare it with all the needed amenities for a modern and cozy experience.
 
And we decided to rent it for tourists.
 
The first of our apartments came to daylight in May 2012. Our yellow apartment.
 
The experience was so overwhelming with massive bookings and great reviews that we decided to ""tackle"" the rest of the building.
 
And so we did.
 
In October 2012 the building went to major refurbishment works with all the structural, electricity, plumbing and communications being changed.
 
We repaired all the commons spaces, painted all the walls and ceilings, changed the windows, repaired and changed the floors, changed all the bathrooms and kitchens while maintaining at the same time all the qualities that give this building itâ€™s finesse.
 
There wasn't a single square inch that we didn't touch!
  
The rest of the apartments came to the market in June 2013 and the bookings went sky high!
 
Right now we have 9 apartments: Blue (6 pax), Yellow (4 pax), Green (2 pax), Pink (2), Brown (2), Orange (2), White (2) , Grey (2) and Red (2)

Again all the critics are excellent with major emphasis on the quality of the apartments and the warm welcomes that both I and my son LuÃ­s provide.
 
This is a family business made with love and with respect for the guests that come here.
 
We want you to feel at home in a foreign place and we like to consider you as more than guests.
 
You are our friends that come to visit our beautiful city.
 
Be prepared to a personalized check in, with our mostly enjoyed briefing on sightseeing, Oporto History and local tips!
 
So, enjoy our apartments!

Welcome to our self-catered apartments!
 
Located on the historical center of Oporto, in the heart of a UNESCO World Heritage Center, you'll find a building that belongs to our family for four generations.
 
After my mother (Lu'is grandmother) passed away in 2010 I inherited this building and found a really degraded space with a lot of structural problems and fierce tenants.
 
Having one apartment vacant me and my sons decided to refurbish the entire apartment and prepare it with all the needed amenities for a modern and cozy experience.
 
And we decided to rent it for tourists.
 
The first of our apartments came to daylight in May 2012. Our yellow apartment.
 
The experience was so overwhelming with massive bookings and great reviews that we decided to ""tackle"" the rest of the building.
 
And so we did.
 
In October 2012 the building went to major refurbishment works with all the structural, electricity, plumbing and communications being changed.
 
We repaired all the commons spaces, painted all the walls and ceilings, changed the windows, repaired and changed the floors, changed all the bathrooms and kitchens while maintaining at the same time all the qualities that give this building itâ€™s finesse.
 
There wasn't a single square inch that we didn't touch!
  
The rest of the apartments came to the market in June 2013 and the bookings went sky high!
 
Right now we have 9 apartments: Blue (6 pax), Yellow (4 pax), Green (2 pax), Pink (2), Brown (2), Orange (2), White (2) , Grey (2) and Red (2)

Again all the critics are excellent with major emphasis on the quality of the apartments and the warm welcomes that both I and my son LuÃ­s provide.
 
This is a family business made with love and with respect for the guests that come here.
 
We want you to feel at home in a foreign place and we like to consider you as more than guests.
 
You are our friends that come to visit our beautiful city.
 
Be prepared to a personalized check in, with our mostly enjoyed briefing on sightseeing, Oporto History and local tips!
 
So, enjoy our apartments!

Welcome to our self-catered apartments!
 
Located on the historical center of Oporto, in the heart of a UNESCO World Heritage Center, you'll find a building that belongs to our family for four generations.
 
After my mother (Lu'is grandmother) passed away in 2010 I inherited this building and found a really degraded space with a lot of structural problems and fierce tenants.
 
Having one apartment vacant me and my sons decided to refurbish the entire apartment and prepare it with all the needed amenities for a modern and cozy experience.
 
And we decided to rent it for tourists.
 
The first of our apartments came to daylight in May 2012. Our yellow apartment.
 
The experience was so overwhelming with massive bookings and great reviews that we decided to ""tackle"" the rest of the building.
 
And so we did.
 
In October 2012 the building went to major refurbishment works with all the structural, electricity, plumbing and communications being changed.
 
We repaired all the commons spaces, painted all the walls and ceilings, changed the windows, repaired and changed the floors, changed all the bathrooms and kitchens while maintaining at the same time all the qualities that give this building itâ€™s finesse.
 
There wasn't a single square inch that we didn't touch!
  
The rest of the apartments came to the market in June 2013 and the bookings went sky high!
 
Right now we have 9 apartments: Blue (6 pax), Yellow (4 pax), Green (2 pax), Pink (2), Brown (2), Orange (2), White (2) , Grey (2) and Red (2)

Again all the critics are excellent with major emphasis on the quality of the apartments and the warm welcomes that both I and my son LuÃ­s provide.
 
This is a family business made with love and with respect for the guests that come here.
 
We want you to feel at home in a foreign place and we like to consider you as more than guests.
 
You are our friends that come to visit our beautiful city.
 
Be prepared to a personalized check in, with our mostly enjoyed briefing on sightseeing, Oporto History and local tips!
 
So, enjoy our apartments!

Welcome to our self-catered apartments!
 
Located on the historical center of Oporto, in the heart of a UNESCO World Heritage Center, you'll find a building that belongs to our family for four generations.
 
After my mother (Lu'is grandmother) passed away in 2010 I inherited this building and found a really degraded space with a lot of structural problems and fierce tenants.
 
Having one apartment vacant me and my sons decided to refurbish the entire apartment and prepare it with all the needed amenities for a modern and cozy experience.
 
And we decided to rent it for tourists.
 
The first of our apartments came to daylight in May 2012. Our yellow apartment.
 
The experience was so overwhelming with massive bookings and great reviews that we decided to ""tackle"" the rest of the building.
 
And so we did.
 
In October 2012 the building went to major refurbishment works with all the structural, electricity, plumbing and communications being changed.
 
We repaired all the commons spaces, painted all the walls and ceilings, changed the windows, repaired and changed the floors, changed all the bathrooms and kitchens while maintaining at the same time all the qualities that give this building itâ€™s finesse.
 
There wasn't a single square inch that we didn't touch!
  
The rest of the apartments came to the market in June 2013 and the bookings went sky high!
 
Right now we have 9 apartments: Blue (6 pax), Yellow (4 pax), Green (2 pax), Pink (2), Brown (2), Orange (2), White (2) , Grey (2) and Red (2)

Again all the critics are excellent with major emphasis on the quality of the apartments and the warm welcomes that both I and my son LuÃ­s provide.
 
This is a family business made with love and with respect for the guests that come here.
 
We want you to feel at home in a foreign place and we like to consider you as more than guests.
 
You are our friends that come to visit our beautiful city.
 
Be prepared to a personalized check in, with our mostly enjoyed briefing on sightseeing, Oporto History and local tips!
 
So, enjoy our apartments!

Welcome to our self-catered apartments!
 
Located on the historical center of Oporto, in the heart of a UNESCO World Heritage Center, you'll find a building that belongs to our family for four generations.
 
After my mother (Lu'is grandmother) passed away in 2010 I inherited this building and found a really degraded space with a lot of structural problems and fierce tenants.
 
Having one apartment vacant me and my sons decided to refurbish the entire apartment and prepare it with all the needed amenities for a modern and cozy experience.
 
And we decided to rent it for tourists.
 
The first of our apartments came to daylight in May 2012. Our yellow apartment.
 
The experience was so overwhelming with massive bookings and great reviews that we decided to ""tackle"" the rest of the building.
 
And so we did.
 
In October 2012 the building went to major refurbishment works with all the structural, electricity, plumbing and communications being changed.
 
We repaired all the commons spaces, painted all the walls and ceilings, changed the windows, repaired and changed the floors, changed all the bathrooms and kitchens while maintaining at the same time all the qualities that give this building itâ€™s finesse.
 
There wasn't a single square inch that we didn't touch!
  
The rest of the apartments came to the market in June 2013 and the bookings went sky high!
 
Right now we have 9 apartments: Blue (6 pax), Yellow (4 pax), Green (2 pax), Pink (2), Brown (2), Orange (2), White (2) , Grey (2) and Red (2)

Again all the critics are excellent with major emphasis on the quality of the apartments and the warm welcomes that both I and my son LuÃ­s provide.
 
This is a family business made with love and with respect for the guests that come here.
 
We want you to feel at home in a foreign place and we like to consider you as more than guests.
 
You are our friends that come to visit our beautiful city.
 
Be prepared to a personalized check in, with our mostly enjoyed briefing on sightseeing, Oporto History and local tips!
 
So, enjoy our apartments!

Poker was a mix of hobby and profession, it came to me by fun, playing online but, started to met people in the real world, and_x000D_
writing for magazines and websites. During 8 years I had an weekly column in J magazine, what ended with an invitation to cooperate with BetClick for the Poker section in their Portuguese branch office. _x000D_
To handle my Poker consulting business, I founded ""Coisas do Poker"" (""Things about Poker). _x000D_
But, my real passion is interior design and receive people._x000D_
Until now, I only practiced in in-house projects, for personal needs, in the different appartments where I lived._x000D_
For eight years, I lived in Luxembourg, where I worked in the headquarters of the European Community Parliament, revising texts for the Portuguese publications._x000D_
After a short return to Portugal, I went to Brazil for one year, this time, just for fun, where I lived in Araras and Rio de Janeiro._x000D_
Now I've embraced, somehow, professional projects in these areas, like this WBwGG"" (White Basement with Green Garden"", the ""Caramba!"" and the ""WHwTG"" (White House with Tasca Gourmet)._x000D_
The ""Caramba!"" is an, already running, project with my friend Marina where we convert old fashioned furniture, and objects, into cool stuff._x000D_
Most of my parent's furniture will be the guinea pig and, once transformed, will be exposed in hot spots in the city but, also, in the house, where guests can see and even use._x000D_
The ""WHwTG"" is on his half way to launch, it's also a guest house but in the countryside, in PÃ³voa da RaÃ­nha, a very small place on the way to Serra da Estrela._x000D_
This is my grandparent's house, a typical old stone house of the Portuguese countryside, which I've adapted to be comfortable but keeping the original trace._x000D_
The purpose here is, not only, receive guests but, also, open the ""tasca gourmet"" to serve, and sell, regional food and beverage and promote tasting events._x000D_
With luck, the project in PÃ³voa da RaÃ­nha can be extended for the family lands that will face the water mirror of the future Girabolhos dam, under construction and, expected to be finished in one, or two years._x000D_
_x000D_
Here is a little of myself, what I've been doing and future projects but, here, may main goal is to have the chance to receive, the best possible, everyone who decides to visit us; that will be an enormous pleasure!_x000D_

Welcome to our self-catered apartments!
 
Located on the historical center of Oporto, in the heart of a UNESCO World Heritage Center, you'll find a building that belongs to our family for four generations.
 
After my mother (Lu'is grandmother) passed away in 2010 I inherited this building and found a really degraded space with a lot of structural problems and fierce tenants.
 
Having one apartment vacant me and my sons decided to refurbish the entire apartment and prepare it with all the needed amenities for a modern and cozy experience.
 
And we decided to rent it for tourists.
 
The first of our apartments came to daylight in May 2012. Our yellow apartment.
 
The experience was so overwhelming with massive bookings and great reviews that we decided to ""tackle"" the rest of the building.
 
And so we did.
 
In October 2012 the building went to major refurbishment works with all the structural, electricity, plumbing and communications being changed.
 
We repaired all the commons spaces, painted all the walls and ceilings, changed the windows, repaired and changed the floors, changed all the bathrooms and kitchens while maintaining at the same time all the qualities that give this building itâ€™s finesse.
 
There wasn't a single square inch that we didn't touch!
  
The rest of the apartments came to the market in June 2013 and the bookings went sky high!
 
Right now we have 9 apartments: Blue (6 pax), Yellow (4 pax), Green (2 pax), Pink (2), Brown (2), Orange (2), White (2) , Grey (2) and Red (2)

Again all the critics are excellent with major emphasis on the quality of the apartments and the warm welcomes that both I and my son LuÃ­s provide.
 
This is a family business made with love and with respect for the guests that come here.
 
We want you to feel at home in a foreign place and we like to consider you as more than guests.
 
You are our friends that come to visit our beautiful city.

Welcome to our self-catered apartments!
 
Located on the historical center of Oporto, in the heart of a UNESCO World Heritage Center, you'll find a building that belongs to our family for four generations.
 
After my mother (Lu'is grandmother) passed away in 2010 I inherited this building and found a really degraded space with a lot of structural problems and fierce tenants.
 
Having one apartment vacant me and my sons decided to refurbish the entire apartment and prepare it with all the needed amenities for a modern and cozy experience.
 
And we decided to rent it for tourists.
 
The first of our apartments came to daylight in May 2012. Our yellow apartment.
 
The experience was so overwhelming with massive bookings and great reviews that we decided to ""tackle"" the rest of the building.
 
And so we did.
 
In October 2012 the building went to major refurbishment works with all the structural, electricity, plumbing and communications being changed.
 
We repaired all the commons spaces, painted all the walls and ceilings, changed the windows, repaired and changed the floors, changed all the bathrooms and kitchens while maintaining at the same time all the qualities that give this building itâ€™s finesse.
 
There wasn't a single square inch that we didn't touch!
  
The rest of the apartments came to the market in June 2013 and the bookings went sky high!
 
Right now we have 9 apartments: Blue (6 pax), Yellow (4 pax), Green (2 pax), Pink (2), Brown (2), Orange (2), White (2) , Grey (2) and Red (2)

Again all the critics are excellent with major emphasis on the quality of the apartments and the warm welcomes that both I and my son LuÃ­s provide.
 
This is a family business made with love and with respect for the guests that come here.
 
We want you to feel at home in a foreign place and we like to consider you as more than guests.
 
You are our friends that come to visit our beautiful city.
 
Be prepared to a personalized check in, with our mostly enjoyed briefing on sightseeing, Oporto History and local tips!
 
So, enjoy our apartments!

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privilege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

O projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientaÃ§Ã£o de proprietÃ¡rios de imÃ³veis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.
Envolve ainda a conceÃ§Ã£o e decoraÃ§Ã£o destes mesmos espaÃ§os, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade Ãºnica que se traduz na reaÃ§Ã£o extremamente positiva dos nossos hÃ³spedes. 
O nosso projeto culmina na gestÃ£o total do imÃ³vel, que inclui a organizaÃ§Ã£o e a preparaÃ§Ã£o destes espaÃ§os para o arrendamento turÃ­stico.

Teresa grew up in Tras-os-Montes in the north of Portugal and I am originally from San Francisco in the U.S.   Our professional backgrounds are in the field of education. Teresa owned and operated her own Montessori pre-school in Porto for 20 years and I taught at the local Universidade  Catolica Portuguesa. We lived in Asia for 5 years where Teresa learned the art of Chinese brush painting. You will see her paintings and other Asian touches in the decoration of our apartment..  I love taking my bicycle for a ride along the river or down the coast, stopping to eat freshly grilled fish at a local restaurant. I also like playing golf on the local courses around the Porto area.  And a great habit I picked up in Asia is the art of tea drinking â€“ I love the ceremony around tea and canâ€™t go a day without my Puer or Oolongs.
